# Development Summary and Current Implementation

## Development Process

1. Project Initialization
   - Set up Electron with React, TypeScript, and Vite
   - Configure build tools and development environment

2. Core Functionality Implementation
   - File system integration
   - Markdown editor with CodeMirror 6
   - Tab management for multiple open files
   - Split pane layout for file explorer and editor
   - Implemented memoization for performance optimization

3. UI Design and Implementation
   - Implement split-pane layout with react-split
   - Create FileExplorer and Editor components
   - Develop TabBar for file navigation
   - Implement dark theme throughout the application

4. Performance Optimization
   - Implement lazy loading for file tree
   - Optimize rendering for large files
   - Use useMemo for Split component to prevent unnecessary re-renders

## Current Implementation

- Basic file system operations (open, read)
- File tree visualization and navigation
- Multi-tab editing interface
- Markdown editing with syntax highlighting
- Split-pane layout for file explorer and editor
- Dark theme implementation
- Persistent split sizes between file explorer and editor
- Improved editor height management for all file types
